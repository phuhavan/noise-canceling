............
WARNING:Place:1109 - A clock IOB / BUFGMUX clock component pair have been found
   that are not placed at an optimal clock IOB / BUFGMUX site pair. The clock
   IOB component <Digilent_AC97_Cntlr_1_BITCLK_pin> is placed at site <T3>. The
   corresponding BUFG component <Digilent_AC97_Cntlr_1_BITCLK_pin_BUFGP/BUFG> is
   placed at site <BUFGMUX_X2Y4>. There is only a select set of IOBs that can
   use the fast path to the Clocker buffer, and they are not being used. You may
   want to analyze why this problem exists and correct it. This is normally an
   ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was applied on COMP.PIN
   <Digilent_AC97_Cntlr_1_BITCLK_pin.PAD> allowing your design to continue. This
   constraint disables all clock placer rules related to the specified COMP.PIN.
   The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor
   timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in
   the design.

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.

  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
